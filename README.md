Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption
This project is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages by providing a shift value.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

ðŸ”¹ Features
Encrypts text with a user-defined shift value
Decrypts text back to its original form
Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged
ðŸ”¹ How It Works
Each letter in the text is shifted forward (encryption) or backward (decryption) by the shift value.
Example:
Message: HELLO
Shift: 3
Encrypted: KHOOR
Decrypted: HELLO
